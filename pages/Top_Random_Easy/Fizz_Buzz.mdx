## 412. Fizz Buzz  

**Level:** Easy

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/description/)

Given an integer `n`, return a string array answer `(1-indexed)` where:

`answer[i] == "FizzBuzz"` if i is divisible by 3 and 5.

`answer[i] == "Fizz"` if i is divisible by 3.

`answer[i] == "Buzz"` if i is divisible by 5.

`answer[i] == i` (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

##Example 1:

`Input: n = 3
Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]` 


`Input: n = 5
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]`

`Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]`

Hint

</summary>
Use a `for` loop to iterate through `numbers` from `1` to `n`. For each number `i`, check its divisibility by `3` and `5`, and based on the result, append `'Fizz,' 'Buzz,'` or `'FizzBuzz'` to the result array. If not divisible by either, add `i.toString()` to the result. This approach minimizes repetitive code and efficiently generates the FizzBuzz sequence.

```javascript
var fizzBuzz = function(n) {
    let result = [];
    for(let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if(i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
            result.push("FizzBuzz");
        } else if(i % 3 === 0) {
            result.push("Fizz");
        } else if(i % 5 === 0) {
            result.push("Buzz");
        } else {
            result.push(i.toString());
        }
    }
    return result;
};


```
`Space complexity: O(n)` - The function creates an array result of size 'n' to store the FizzBuzz values for each number from 1 to 'n'.

`Time complexity: O(n`) - The function uses a for loop that iterates from 1 to 'n', performing a constant number of operations for each iteration. As 'n' increases, the number of operations also increases linearly, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).
